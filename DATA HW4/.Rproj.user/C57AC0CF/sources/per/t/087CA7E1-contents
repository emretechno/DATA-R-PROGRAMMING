### <font color = "BROWN">[*INTRODUCTION*]{.underline}</font>

*Obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition that has become a major public health concern worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. This document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of obesity-related data to uncover insights and trends that can inform public health strategies. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from \[Kaggle's Obesity Dataset\](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)*

### <font color = "BROWN">[*DATA OVERVIEW*]{.underline}</font>

### Below are the libraries necessary for this homework.

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(DT)

```

### <font color="BROWN">[***IMPORTING DATASET***]{.underline}</font>

#### Let's start with loading the data first.

```{r}
my_data <-read.csv("/Users/y.emrekilicer/Desktop/DATA KONU PROJE ODEV/DATA HW4/ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv")


```

### <font color="BROWN">[***GENERAL OVERVIEW***]{.underline}</font>

```{r}
#BEFORE START ANYTHING , THE DATA WILL BE PRINTED AS DATATABLE.



my_data %>%
  datatable(
    caption="THE GENERAL OVERVIEW OF IMPORTED DATA",
    options = list(
      pageLength = 7,
      autoWitdh = TRUE
    ))

### <font color="BROWN">[***DATA CLEANING***]{.underline}</font>

```{r}
# Clean and standardize column names to lowercase and remove special characters for consistency
my_data <- clean_names(my_data)

# Identify and display duplicated rows if any exist
duplicated_df <- my_data[duplicated(my_data) | duplicated(my_data, fromLast = TRUE), ]
duplicated_df %>%
  head(6) %>%
  kable(caption = "Duplicated Rows")

# Remove duplicated rows using the distinct function
prev_num_rows <- nrow(my_data)
my_data <- distinct(my_data)
new_num_rows <- nrow(my_data)

message <- paste("The number of rows has been updated to ", new_num_rows, ". Previously, it was ", prev_num_rows, ".", sep="")
cat(message, "\n")

# Check for missing values in the dataset
if (any(is.na(my_data))) {
  cat("Warning: The dataset contains missing values. Please handle them with caution.\n")
} else {
  cat("There are no missing values in the dataset.\n")
}

### <font color="BROWN">[***OBESITY LEVELS AND FAMILY HISTORY***]{.underline}</font>

*Understanding the relationship between obesity levels and family history of overweight can provide insights into genetic and environmental factors contributing to obesity.*

### <font color="BROWN">[***ANALYSIS OF FAMILY HISTORY***]{.underline}</font>

```{r}
#I want to show relation between family history with overweight relation and obesity level.

 relations<-my_data %>%
  group_by(n_obeyesdad, family_history_with_overweight) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
  
 
 relations %>%
  datatable(caption = "Counts of Obesity Levels by Family History",options = list(pageLength = 13))

#As we can see, people who are overweight or have more weight than normal often have a relationship with their families overweight.
```

```{r}
#LET'S ALSO VISUALIZE THIS :

ggplot(relations, aes(x = family_history_with_overweight, y = count, fill = n_obeyesdad)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(count, 2)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Obesity Levels by Family History of Overweight",
    x = "Family History of Overweight",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Obesity Level"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

*Physical activity is a crucial factor in managing and preventing obesity*.

*Also understanding eating habits is essential for addressing obesity.*

### <font color="BROWN">[***BMI CALCULATION AND***]{.underline} [***ANALYSIS***]{.underline} </font>

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a commonly used measure to classify overweight and obesity in adults

[To understand what is BMI , please click here](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html "DETAILED EXPLANATION OF BMI")

I think ~~everyone~~ knows the formula of BMI.Let me write it again :

$BMI = \frac{\textbf{Weight}}{\textbf{Height}^{2}}$

and the units can be expressed as :

\
\$\$\\frac{\\textbf{kg}}{\\textbf{m}\^{2}}\$\$

### <font color="BROWN">[*ADDING BMI TO THE DATASET*]{.underline} </font>

| Category           | BMI       |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Underweight        | \<18.5    |
| Normal weight      | 18.5-24.9 |
| Overweight         | 25.0-29.9 |
| Obesity( Class I ) | 30.0-34.9 |
| Obesity(Class II)  | 35-39.9   |
| Obesity(Class III) | \>40      |

: Table showing classification of Obesity using the Body Mass Index (BMI)

```{r}
#Now , it is time to add new features to our dataset.
#First , let's calculate the BMI of every person.
  
calc_bmi <- \(dataset) {
      dataset %>%
      mutate(BMI = weight  / (height * height) )
  
}

my_data <- calc_bmi(my_data) 

#Let's check if it was added as new column.
my_data %>% 
        head(5) %>%
        datatable()

```

```{r}
# Group by obesity level and summarize mean BMI and age
  obesity_summary <- my_data %>%
    group_by(n_obeyesdad) %>%
    summarise(
      mean_BMI = mean(BMI),
      mean_age = mean(age),
      total_num = n()
    )

  obesity_summary %>%
    datatable(caption = "Summary Statistics by Obesity Level")
  
```

### <font color="BROWN">[*OBESITY LEVEL AND BMI DISTRIBUTION*]{.underline} </font>

```{r}
#Visualization
# Create the density plot
ggplot(my_data, aes(x = BMI, fill = n_obeyesdad)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of BMI by Obesity Level",
    x = "BMI",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

[*This density plot highlights how BMI values are distributed across various obesity levels, providing a clear visualization of the BMI ranges corresponding to each category.*]{.underline}

### <font color="BROWN">[*CREATING NEW FEATURE  : AGE GROUP*]{.underline} </font>

```{r}
# Create a new feature: Age group

my_data <- my_data %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age < 20 ~ "Teenager",
      age < 35 ~ "Young Adult",
      age < 50 ~ "Middle Age",
      TRUE ~ "Senior"

# Group by age group and summarize mean BMI
age_group_summary <- my_data %>%

    mean_BMI = mean(BMI),

# Display the age group summary

## <font color="RED">***CONCLUSION***</font>

*Obesity is a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors, including genetics, physical activity, and eating habits. Through this analysis, we have highlighted key insights and trends that can help inform public health strategies. Further research and intervention are necessary to address this growing public health concern effectively.*
